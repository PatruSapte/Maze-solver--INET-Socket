# Maze-solver--INET-Socket
INET C server and client (+stupid java client) + java path finder code to find escape from a image pixel-maze or ascii 2d array character-maze

Java client can send file to c server but it cannot recieve back. C client is fine i guess, it explode sometimes.

The code is bad, ugly and really depressing
